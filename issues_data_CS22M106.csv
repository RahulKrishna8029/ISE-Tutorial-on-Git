It allows anyone to click a button in the `README.md` to start an ephemeral development environment with VS Code and a terminal running in the browser.

This helps lower the barrier for people to look at the algorithm code in a familiar environment and saves time following the ""How to use this repository"" instructions locally.

95,657,Future Browser-Based Web Demo for Algorithms?,[],open,"Hi,

I was wondering if any of the maintainers have considered creating a webpage for all of the demos? I searched through the issues but didn't find anything related.

Personally I think if you have a web version of all demos it would be of great benefit for developers so they could test the algorithms directly in a browser and step through the code if desired. I'm aware that a developer can step through the code using a debugger with Node, however if there was a website it would lower the barrier since there is nothing to install. Additionally you could run Carbon ads or something which can help with sponsorship of this project.

Since modern browsers support `import` and other needed JS I would expect all or most algorithms to work out of the box for most browsers. I pulled a fork and create a small proof of concept to test.

**Three files added for Demo**
* `index.html`
* `favicon.ico`
* `server.js`

**Additional Changes**
* The demo shows `QuickSort` and `BubbleSort`; in order to work with GitHub Pages I modified 3 files to use full file name `import Sort from '../Sort.js';` instead of `import Sort from '../Sort';`

**Notes**
* This runs from GitHub pages simply by adding the `index.html` file (and optional `favicon.ico` file) and modifying needed JS files for full file name on import.
* The file `server.js` is a simple Node Web Server for sending static files using using only Node.js built-in features without any outside dependencies. If you have node you run the site locally using `node server.js`. I created the `server.js` for another project I maintain and made slight changes so it could handle `import '.../File'` for this project.

`https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/blob/master/src/algorithms/math/fast-powering/fastPowering.js`

It can be resolved by adding the below if statement to the code.

` if(power<0){
      power=power*-1;
      base=1/base;
     // console.log(base);
      fastPowering(base,power);
  }`

Can I open a pull request to work on this?

You will probably need a final mask to get the key in the domain of your table, since you probably do not want to devote a full 31 bits of contiguous memory space to the hash buckets (unless your hardware supports sparse arrays).

139,498,Counting Sort optimization,[],open,"Hi devs!
On the very beginning I want to appreciate your work here, I think it is fantastic and gives a lot of addition to developers knowledge!

But this ticket I want to open to point potential optimization of Counting Sort algorithm.

In the implementation there are is loop by all array elements to find smallest and biggest.
Next step is creating counting array of size dependent on smallest and biggest.
And in next step there is one more iteration by all elements to set up counting array.

I am wondering if there could be optimization applied and make all of those in just 1 iteration, moreover there could be used lookup instead of array.

Lets consider this example of array to be sorted:
`const arrayToSort = [1, 1, 10000, 1, 1, 10000, 10000, 1, 1];`
When switched to lookup object instead of array we will have small object:
`{""1"": 6, ""10000"": 3}`
When using array it will be bigger:
`[0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, ....(a lot of zeros), 10000]`

So finally we could find biggest, smallest and set lookup values in 1 iteration and having lesser memory used.

I prepared example of that:
*The next difference is that I am preparing algorithm which is mutating original array, but it can be applied here too:
[example](https://github.com/ohoho7/tytyryty-blog-examples/blob/master/sorting-algorithmes/counting-sort.ts)

If you just change the value in `this.vertices`, it will not be able to propagate to edges referencing this vertex.\r\n\r\nThe old behavior allowed to entirely **replace** a vertex, and if it was referenced somewhere, the reference was lost and concluded to a data corruption.\r\n\r\nIt\'s either this, or create a full-fledged propagation system, which is way more complex.\r\n\r\nI decided to go ""the easy way"" by disallowing adding vertices twice :)', 'Interesting.

So I get 8 results in the output. The first path from the array is all good until you get to `3_6` to `3_3` as you can see from the code there is no `edge3_6_3_3`🤷🏻‍♂️am I just miss understanding what this does or am I miss using it?

you can get from `3_3` to `3_6` but not back, which it fine right it's a directional graph. Using a different library I checked for cycles, it said that this graph was one big cycle.

any help would be appreciated.",[]
